# Classic Arcade Game Clone Project

A simple Frogger-style game, made as a student project for Udacity's [Front-End Development Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011).

## Install
Download the repo, or clone with:

`$ git clone https://github.com/dinakonto/arcade-game.git`

Then open `index.html` in your browser to play.

## How to play
Use the arrow keys (left &larr; right &rarr; up &uarr; down &darr;) to help your player reach the water, collecting gems and avoiding any bugs along the way.

- **Reach the water** for 100 points.
- **Collect a gem** for 50 points.
- **Collide with a bug** to lose 1 heart and start again from the bottom.
- **Lose all 3 hearts** and it's game over.

ðŸ•¹ Good luck!
